    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Forgot those low-fat or no-fat options... holiday mashed potatoes are supposed to have a ridiculous amount of butter in them! 
        Eating a scoop of these potatoes a few times a year is a well-deserved treat. Garnish with chives if desired. 
        If you're never experienced this ethereal pleasure, I hope you make them a part of your next special occasion menu. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3&frac14 pounds russet potatoes</li>

        <li>1 pound unsalted European-style butter</li>

        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>&frac14 cup hot milk</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel potatoes and cut into quarters. Transfer to a bowl of cold water and rinse to remove starch. 
            Drain and transfer to a pot of cold water. Very generously salt the water and bring to a boil over high heat. 
            Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are soft and the tip of a knife goes in easily, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, cut butter in chunks and let come to room temperature.</li>

        <li>Drain potatoes thoroughly and return to the pot. Set over medium-low heat and mash with a potato masher until potatoes. 
            Season with salt and pepper and add Â¼ of the softened butter chunks. Mash until butter just about disappears.</li>

        <li>Add another 1/4 of the butter and mix with a wire whisk until it just about disappears. 
            Whisk in the remaining butter in 2 additions as before; potatoes will be light and creamy after all the butter has been mixed in.</li>

        <li>Whisk in hot milk until incorporated. Add cayenne and more salt if needed. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
